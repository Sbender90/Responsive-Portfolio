      <img src="assets/images/me-2018-3.jpg" class="my-pic" alt="Steven Bender">

      <p>My name is Steven Bender, I was born in Fargo, North Dakota. I am
      married and have 2 boys. most of my free time is spent with my kids and we
      like to play outside and do puzzles. I also like to play hockey, either
      just passing the puck to my son's in the drive way or playing ice hockey
      in an adult league.</p>

      <p>I also like to cook, my favorite thing to make it probably tacos, and
      pork chops. I listen to a variety of music genres but my go too favorites
      are classic rock, bluegrass, and alternitive rock. My favorite band is The
      Grateful Dead. I have lisetned to them my whole life, and I went to my
      first show when I was just 3 months old. My dad used to always tell people
      he met how he thought I was blssed by Jerry, since he nodded at him while
      he was holding me in the 3rd row at the first show they took me too. </p>
